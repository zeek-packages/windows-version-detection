   Windows systems access a Microsoft Certificate Revocation List (CRL) periodically. The
   user agent for these requests reveals which version of Crypt32.dll installed on the system,
   which can uniquely identify the version of Windows that's running.
   
   This script will log the version of Windows that was identified to the Software framework.
